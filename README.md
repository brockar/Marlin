Marlin is the world's most popular open source firmware for 3D printers. [Marlin 2.0](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/bugfix-2.0.x). The SKR 1.3's processor is LPB 1768. But the rest of the things are what the Ender 3 brings from the factory.

I'm owner of this configuration, I did it following some videos and foros. I had some problems along the way, they was the hot of the motors, the hotend, it burns twice, and I change it to a V6 by trianglelab.
