## Marlin 2.0 Bugfix Branch

__Not for production use. Use with caution!__

Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

This branch is for patches to the latest 2.0.x release version. Periodically this branch will form the basis for the next minor 2.0.x release.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). We've posted detailed instructions on [Building Marlin with Arduino](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html) and [Building Marlin with PlatformIO for ReArm](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_rearm.html) (which applies well to other 32-bit boards).

## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Marlin 2.0 introduces a layer of abstraction so that all the existing high-level code can be built for 32-bit platforms while still retaining full 8-bit AVR compatibility. Retaining AVR compatibility and a single code-base is important to us, because we want to make sure that features and patches get as much testing and attention as possible, and that all platforms always benefit from the latest improvements.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
# Marlin 2.1.x on Ender 3 with a SKR 1.3 and TMC 2130 (SPI) (Sensorless and silent) (Bigtree)
<img align="right" src="../../raw/1.1.x/buildroot/share/pixmaps/logo/marlin-250.png" />

<img align="right" src="https://www.hta3d.com/image/cache/cache/1-1000/386/main/9d54-SKR-1.3-01-0-4-550x550.jpg" alt="Image" height="200" width="200" />

Marlin is the world's most popular open source firmware for 3D printers. [Marlin 2.0](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/bugfix-2.0.x). The SKR 1.3's processor is LPB 1768. But the rest of the things are what the Ender 3 brings from the factory.

I'm owner of this configuration, I did it following some videos and foros. I had some problems along the way, they was the hot of the motors, the hotend, it burns twice, and I change it to a V6 by trianglelab.
If you haven't V6 by trianglelab, in thermistor configuration you have to put "1" instead of "5".

I use Sensorless except in Z, for that you may have to weld somethings, but I hadn't, the TMC 2130 SPI come ready to connect and ready, but it's more expensive. To end stop in Z, have to remove the red switch, near LCD conection. .The Sensorless could be changed in the Firmware or in the LCD, if you change in LCD, you have to save in EEPROM, or when you turn off the printer, it'll lose. 

The file that you have to put in the SD Card is "firmware.bin", you MUST to move it, or copy&paste and later delete it. "firmware.bin" can't be in the folder before you compile. The firmware is in "C:...\Marlin\.pio\build\LPC1768\".

After do all this, you must to do a step calibration, and a PID again. 

Here you have some tutorials that could helps you. 

How to connect and configurate:

When you connect the LCD, the pins go upside down.

To configure Marlin, you need Platform.io in a code editor, it could be Visual Studio Code or ATOM, I did all in ATOM.
